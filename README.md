# YATodolist

Yet another Todolist

## Why I'm creating YATodolist?

In my company, when new employees come to an React&Flux app, they have no idea about what's going on, and it always takes a while to explain the whole thing.

And there's no single React&Flux project meets the requirement that it can explain every essential part in developing React&Flux App for the beginning one week.

So I decided to create one.

## What can YATodolist demonstrate?
* How to use *React*.
* How to use *Flux*.
* How does *asynchronous request* between React&Flux app and backend look like.
* How to use [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) to pakcage assets of an app and how to use when developing the app.
* How to build a simple *nodejs server* using *express*.
* How to use a database called [nedb](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb) that help you store plain json data in local file with examples of *create, query, update, delete*.
* Other examples for using npm packages *immutable, react-bootstrap, jquery, moment ...*

## Run it!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pairyo/YATodolist.git
npm install webpack webpack-dev-server -g
npm install
npm run production
node server.js
```
Then enter url `http://localhost:1314/`. Now, it should work!

## Develop it
Simply adding one more command `npm run development` to start `webpack-dev-server`, then enter url `http://localhost:1314/development`.

Everything you changed in asset files whill now automatically compiled. Hitting refresh button fo the page, everything will be updated!
